# Reverse-Shell
A python reverse shell that uses multi-threading and network programming to control multiple computers connected to the internet via a remote server.

Access to the remote server is through the added SSH keys. 
In your BASH shell, access the remote server through entering the command "ssh <username>@<server_ip>" and enter the passphrase.
